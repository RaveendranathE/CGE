- Git clone https://bitbucket.org/nw_webapps_2017_spring/cge 


# Modular design 

The applications helps our client create cost estimates for:

- Roofing jobs
- Flooring jobs
- Waterproofing jobs

Each type of estimate shares common features

- Based on area (sqft)
- Includes material costs
- Includes mileage
- Includes labor
- Includes miscellaneous costs

# Collaborative effort

We are building on work produced by the Fall 2016 Web Apps developers.

Please see the About / Teams pages for more information about how to contact us. 

# Process

This application will be started in A04, extended in A05, and completed in A06.

# Initialize (do these just once when setting up the project)

Clone a copy of your section repository to your c:\44563 folder.

Open a command window in this project folder (e.g. C:\44563\jc2).

Install nodemon globally to enable live updates.

```
> npm install -g nodemon
```

Install Typescript globally to enable TypeScript language features.

```
> npm install -g typescript
```

Install Yarn globally to enable Yarn package manager. Download Yarn from 
https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-tab and install using the defaults.
Verify by checking the version.

```
> yarn --version
```

# Install dependencies as needed before running the app

Run npm install to install all the dependencies in the package.json file 
once before you begin and as new dependencies are added.

```
> npm install
```

OR run faster, safer yarn install. Yarn performs the same functions as npm. Install is the default yarn command, so you an just type "yarn" to update all dependencies and the autogenerated yarn.lock file.

```
> yarn install
> yarn 
```

- In variable value go all the way to the end of the text and add ";C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin" to it

Right-click on the project folder and open Git Bash. Run mongod to start MongoDB.  (When done working the application, you can hit CTRL-C to stop.)

```
$ mongod 
```

# Run the app

In Windows, right-click on the project folder and "Open Command Window Here as Administrator". At the prompt, type nodemon app to start the server.  (CTRL-C to stop.)

```
> nodemon app.js
```

Point your browser to `http://localhost:8082` 

# Building and editing the code

# PULL FIRST 

For a better experiences, never make changes to stale code.

Before making any changes, pull new code. 

Make small changes and commit. 

If away from the code for awhile, always pull new code. 

The repo will change OFTEN and A LOT. :)
